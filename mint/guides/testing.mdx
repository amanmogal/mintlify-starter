# Testing

## Test Structure

Tests are organized in `AppleSerialScanner/Tests/`:

### Unit Tests
**Location**: `Tests/Unit/`

Test individual components in isolation.

**Example**:
```swift
#if canImport(XCTest)
import XCTest
@testable import AppleSerialScanner

class MyServiceTests: XCTestCase {
    func testMyMethod() {
        let service = MyService()
        let result = service.myMethod()
        XCTAssertNotNil(result)
    }
}
#endif
```

### Integration Tests
**Location**: `Tests/Integration/`

Test component interactions and workflows.

### Performance Tests
**Location**: `Tests/Performance/`

Measure performance characteristics:
- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Network latency
- Frame rate

### UAT Tests
**Location**: `Tests/UAT/`

User acceptance tests and accessibility tests.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
xcodebuild test -scheme AppleSerialScanner

# Run specific test
xcodebuild test -scheme AppleSerialScanner \
  -only-testing:AppleSerialScannerTests/MyServiceTests
```

## Test Files

All test files are wrapped with `#if canImport(XCTest)` to prevent compilation errors when included in the main app target.
